# Feature-Fusion and Quality Estimation

## To-Do

This folder contains the regressor trained on Spatial-video Quality Human-Study. It expects as inputs: 

### 2D Quality Features
### 3D Quality Features
### Depth Features

The script will concatenate all the features and use the trained regressor to compute a single quality score.
