# Project Setup

This document provides instructions to compute Spatial Quality Assessment Score for a video.

## 2D Feature Extraction

Use the 2D\_Feature\_Extractor for extracting 2D/image-level quality features.


# To-Do

## 3D Feature Extraction

Use the 3D\_Feature\_Extractor for extracting temporal/video-level quality features.

## Depth Feature Extraction

Use the Depth\_Feature\_Extractor for extracting depth features.

## Feature-Fusion and Quality Score Estimation

Concatenate the obtained features and estimate quality using the trained regressor (trained on human-study data from the Spatial-Quality Human-Study).
